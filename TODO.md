# TODO

- [x] Create an overall project `README.md` for architecture, scope, setup, and contributor onboarding.
- [ ] Track and attach external Sprint 5/6 attestations in governance/QA packets once received: business-owner UAT attestation and 2,000-user no-bend performance certification (outside this repository today).
